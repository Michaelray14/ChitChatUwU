Multistream Chat

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is a Multistream Chat?</h2>

A Multistream Chat is an application that aggregates live chats from multiple streaming platforms into one interface. It allows streamers who are multistreaming to view chats from Twitch, YouTube, Kick, etc all in one place.

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

Chit Chat UwU connects to the APIs of supported streaming platforms to pull in live chat messages in real-time. Users can log in to their accounts on each platform to authenticate and enable chat aggregation. The chats will then appear synchronized in the Chit Chat UwU interface, each labeled with the username and platform icon for context. 

<h2>What streaming platforms are currently supported?</h2>

Currently, Chit Chat UwU supports Twitch, YouTube, and Kick. Additional platforms may be added in future releases based on demand and API availability.

<h2>Can I customize how chats appear?</h2>

Yes, users have full control over enabled chats. You can toggle chats on/off for each connected platform. There are also settings to filter chat messages, mute users, and customize text size, colors, and fonts.

<h2>Does Chit Chat UwU work for moderation?</h2> 

Moderator capabilities are limited to what the native platforms allow through their APIs. Moderators can hide, delete, timeout, and ban users directly through the Multistream Chat interface and it will sync across connected platforms. But advanced mod tools may need to be accessed through the individual platforms.

<h2>Is my data secure when I log in through Multistream Chat?</h2>

User data protection is very important to us. Login credentials are authenticated via HTTPS and access tokens are encrypted and stored locally only. Chat message data is pulled on-demand and not stored. We do not collect any personal user data.
